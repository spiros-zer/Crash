## 7. Add the Jump Input Action
Use `PawnClientRestart` reccomended place to register input mappings. Once htis is triggered it wlll be the first time the player exists on client.

> Before adding an input mapping it's best to remove it first.

Use ACharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent to bind to input actions.
